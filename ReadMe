Tic-Tac-Toe with 3 levels of difficulty: basic/easy, medium and hard

Modes: user-user, user-ai, ai-ai
AI options: easy, medium, hard

The board is 3 X 3 with the following coordinates for user input:
(1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3)
(1, 2) (2, 2) (3, 2)
(1, 1) (2, 1) (3, 1)

Example user input:
start user easy
/or
start user hard
/or
start hard hard
/or
start hard easy

exit - to exit the program

The AI algorithms:
Easy: just random picking of the coordinated from the remaining available steps
Medium: make winning step if there is such, make blocking the counterpart win if there is such, otherwise make random step
Hard: if the board is empty - make random step, otherwise MiniMax algorithm will make the step
